## PHP Challenge
![PHP Developer Hiring Challenge](img/01.png)

Hi,

We are looking for professional PHP developers to join our team. Instead of going through a ~~boring~~ long interview process, we decided that code often speaks for itself. If you're up to the challenge, please take an hour to play with these problems and submit your solutions.

### Submission

Please DO NOT submit a Pull Request!

If you've solved some of these, don't publish them as a fork of this repo, or it will spoil the fun for everyone else :-). You can create a secret gist with a free Github account and after you're done, please send an email to [a.radmand@etick.ir](mailto:a.radmand@etick.ir) with the link to your fork so we can start talking =)

### Disclaimer

THIS IS NOT FREE WORK. We found these challenges on github and there is already many solutions to each one available on the internet. Your proposal will only be used to evaluate the quality of your work and resourcefulness of your solution.

Regards,
